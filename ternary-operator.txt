Regular Conditional
    if(obj.score >= min) {
        obj.pass = true;
    } else {
        obj.pass = false;
    }

Ternary Conditional
    obj.score >= min ? obj.pass = true : obj.pass = false;

    The 1st part of the ternary is the condition itself.
    The 2nd part following the ? is the true part.
    The 3rd part following the : is the else part.

    In order to make this even shorter/cleaner, we can do this also:

    obj.pass = obj.score >= min ? true : false;
